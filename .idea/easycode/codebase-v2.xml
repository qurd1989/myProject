The key functions are the constructors, getArea(), and getParameter().\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/inheritance/ThreedPoint.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a ThreedPoint class.\\n\\nKey things about the ThreedPoint class:\\n\\n- It is in the inheritance package\\n- It is a public class, so it can be accessed from other classes\\n- It does not define any fields or methods yet\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- ThreedPoint.java defines a class called ThreedPoint\\n- It is a public class that can be accessed from other classes\\n- Currently it does not define any fields or methods - it is an empty class definition\\n\\nSome things that could be added to make it more functional:\\n\\n- Fields to store x, y, z coordinates \\n- Constructor(s) to initialize the point\\n- Getter methods for the coordinates\\n- Methods to calculate distance, do translations/rotations etc.\\n\\nSo in its current state it is just an empty class definition that could be built out further to represent 3D points with additional fields and methods. The intent seems to be for it to model 3D points by extending the functionality of a 2D point.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/pages/Circle.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Circle class that represents a circle.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- getArea() - Returns the area of the circle based on its radius using the formula πr^2\\n\\n- getParameter() - Returns the circumference of the circle based on its radius using the formula 2πr \\n\\n- isOverLapping() - Checks if the current circle overlaps with another passed in circle by comparing the distance between their centers to the sum of their radii. If the distance is less than or equal to the sum, they overlap.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a Circle class \\n- Has functions to calculate area, circumference \\n- Can check if a circle overlaps with another circle\\n\\nThe class defines the basic properties and behaviors of a circle object in code.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/constructor/Rectangle.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Rectangle.java file defines a Rectangle class that represents a rectangle using two Point objects to specify the top left and bottom right corners.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Constructor that takes x,y coordinates for the top left and bottom right points to initialize the rectangle. This does a deep copy of the points.\\n\\n- Constructor that takes Point objects for the top left and bottom right to initialize the rectangle. Again does a deep copy of the points. \\n\\n- Copy constructor that takes another Rectangle and makes a deep copy to initialize the new rectangle, copying over the point values from the other rectangle. \\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It defines a Rectangle class using two Point objects \\n- Provides different constructors to initialize a rectangle from coordinates or existing Point objects\\n- Copy constructor to make a deep copy of another rectangle\\n\\nThe key aspects are representing the rectangle using two Point objects, and the different constructor options including deep copying of the point values.\&quot;,\&quot;/pom.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This pom.xml file is the project object model file for a Maven project. It defines key information about the project and its configuration.\\n\\nSome key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines the project coordinates - groupId, artifactId, version\\n- Sets the model version\\n- Defines project properties like the Java compiler source/target versions and encoding\\n- Configures plugins - in this case it adds the maven-clean-plugin dependency\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Identifies the project \\n- Configures build properties like source/target versions\\n- Allows adding dependencies on plugins and libraries\\n- Provides configuration for the build lifecycle (clean, compile, test, package etc) \\n- Standardizes project metadata and configuration\\n- Enables use of Maven\\u0027s dependency management and repository functionality\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides the core configuration and metadata for building the project with Maven and standardizes how it is structured and packaged. This allows Maven to interpret the POM and execute the defined build lifecycle.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/inheritance/Point.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Point.java file defines a Point class that represents a two-dimensional point with x and y coordinates.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a public Point class in the inheritance package\\n- Declares protected x and y integer fields to store the point coordinates\\n- Provides a public display() method that prints out the point coordinates in bracket notation \\n- The x and y fields are protected so they can be accessed by subclasses\\n- No constructor is defined, so the default no-arg constructor is used\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- x and y protected fields - store the point coordinates\\n- display() - prints out the point coordinates \\n- Inherits from Object class by default since no other superclass is specified\\n- Implicit no-arg constructor allows creating Point objects without parameters\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a basic Point class with x,y coordinates that can be extended by subclasses, and includes a display method to output point values. The protected fields allow subclasses to access and modify the coordinate values.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/pages/Point.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Point class that represents a point object with a name and price.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines a Point class with private name and price fields\\n- Constructor to initialize name and price \\n- Getter methods for name and price\\n- Setter methods for name and price\\n- Main method to test the class\\n\\nIn the main method:\\n\\n- It creates a Point object with name \\\&quot;Three points\\\&quot; and price 34\\n- It creates another Point object point1 and assigns it to point, so they reference the same object\\n- It changes the name of point to \\\&quot;elmar\\\&quot;\\n- It prints the name of point and point1, both will print \\\&quot;elmar\\\&quot; since they reference the same object\\n\\nSo in summary, it:\\n\\n- Defines a Point class to represent a point object\\n- Allows setting/getting the name and price \\n- Demonstrates that changing a field of one reference changes it for another referencing the same object\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/thread/Caluclator.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Runnable class called Caluclator that implements the run() method to calculate prime numbers between 1 and 20000.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- run() - The main logic that calculates prime numbers in a loop and prints the results.\\n\\n- isPrime() - A helper method that checks if a number is prime using trial division. \\n\\n- main() - Creates 10 threads with different priorities, starts them, and logs their status changes to a file.\\n\\n- writeThreadInfo() - A helper method to log thread status changes to the output file. \\n\\nThe main() method:\\n\\n- Prints the minimum, normal and maximum priority constants\\n- Creates an array of 10 Thread objects using the Caluclator runnable \\n- Sets alternating priorities to max and min\\n- Starts logging initial states to a file\\n- Starts all the threads\\n- Polls the threads in a loop until all terminate\\n- Logs any state changes to the file\\n\\nSo in summary, it demonstrates creating threads with different priorities to calculate primes, and logs their execution details to a file. The isPrime() method implements the core prime number logic.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/inheritanceAndPorlimorphism/Client.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Client class that:\\n\\n1. Contains a main method which is the entry point of the program. It prints out the remainder of -8 % 7 and -8 floorMod 7 to demonstrate the difference between % and floorMod operators.\\n\\n2. Defines a static display method that takes an Iterable as a parameter. It iterates through the Iterable and prints out each element. \\n\\n3. This display method is meant to be called to display the contents of a Stack, as hinted by the question requirements mentioned in the comment.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It contains the main method for program entry point\\n- Prints out examples of % and floorMod operators \\n- Defines a static display method to print out elements of an Iterable\\n- The display method is meant to be called to display a Stack, as per question requirements\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n1. main() - Entry point \\n2. display() - Static method to print out elements of an Iterable like a Stack\\n\\nSo this file sets up the basic Client class with a main method and display utility method to be used to display the contents of a Stack, as required by the question.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/pages/Student.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a Student class with the following:\\n\\n- It has two instance variables - int age and String name\\n\\n- It has two methods:\\n  - display() - Prints the name and age of the student\\n  - sayHello(String name) - Prints a greeting from the student to the passed name\\n\\n- It has a main method to test the class:\\n  - It creates two Student objects - s1 and s2\\n  - s1 is initialized with age 10 and name \\\&quot;Test\\\&quot;\\n  - s2 is assigned the reference of s1, so they point to the same object\\n  - s2\\u0027s properties are changed to age 20 and name \\\&quot;B\\\&quot;\\n  - display() is called on s2 and s1 to see the changes\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines a Student class with name and age properties\\n- display() prints student details \\n- sayHello() prints a greeting from student\\n- main() method tests class by creating objects and calling methods\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a Student class with properties and methods, and has a main method to test creating objects and calling methods on the class.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
